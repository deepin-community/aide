Description: Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment - static binary
 AIDE is an intrusion detection system that detects changes to files on
 the local system. It creates a database from the regular expression rules
 that it finds from the config file. Once this database is initialized
 it can be used to verify the integrity of the files. It has several
 message digest algorithms (md5, sha1, rmd160, tiger, haval, etc.) that are
 used to check the integrity of the file. More algorithms can be added
 with relative ease. All of the usual file attributes can also be checked
 for inconsistencies.
 .
 This package contains the statically linked binary for "normal"
 systems.

Description: Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment - transitional package
 AIDE is an intrusion detection system that detects changes to files on
 the local system. It creates a database from the regular expression rules
 that it finds from the config file. Once this database is initialized
 it can be used to verify the integrity of the files. It has several
 message digest algorithms (md5, sha1, rmd160, tiger, haval, etc.) that are
 used to check the integrity of the file. More algorithms can be added
 with relative ease. All of the usual file attributes can also be checked
 for inconsistencies.
 .
 This is a transitional package to allow the seamless replacement of the
 aide-xen package with the normal aide package. The reason for aide-xen
 does not seem to exist any more. If you have difficulties with running aide
 on XEN-enabled systems in Dom0 or DomU, please file a bug.

Description: Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment - dynamic binary
 AIDE is an intrusion detection system that detects changes to files on
 the local system. It creates a database from the regular expression rules
 that it finds from the config file. Once this database is initialized
 it can be used to verify the integrity of the files. It has several
 message digest algorithms (md5, sha1, rmd160, tiger, haval, etc.) that are
 used to check the integrity of the file. More algorithms can be added
 with relative ease. All of the usual file attributes can also be checked
 for inconsistencies.
 .
 This package contains a dynamically linked binary and should only be
 used in exeptional circumstances. To avoid exposure to trojaned
 libraries, it is advised to use one of the statically linked binaries.

Description: Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment - Common files
 AIDE is an intrusion detection system that detects changes to files on
 the local system. It creates a database from the regular expression rules
 that it finds from the config file. Once this database is initialized
 it can be used to verify the integrity of the files. It has several

 for inconsistencies.
 .
 This package contains base and configuration files that are needed to
 run the actual binaries.
 .
 You will almost certainly want to tweak the configuration file in
 /etc/aide/aide.conf or drop your own config snippets into
 /etc/aide/aide.conf.d.
